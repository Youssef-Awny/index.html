  <li> Central processing unit ( CPU )
  <p> it’s the brain of the computer which control all functions of the computer’s components <P>
   <h2> the components of CPU <h2>
   the two typical components of CPU including the following 
   <ol> 
    <li> The Arithmetic logic unit (Alu) : which performs arithmetic and logic operations 
    <li> The Control Unit (CU) : which extracts instructions from memory and decodes and excutes them , calling on the ALU when necessary .
