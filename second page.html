<h4> style="color:blue">How to classify devices into input and output devices.<h4>
<p>The designation of a device as either input or output depends on perspective. Micee and keyboards take physical movements that the human user outputs and convert them into input signals that a computer can understand; the output from these devices is the computer's input. Similarly, printers and monitors take signals that a computer outputs as input, and they convert these signals into a representation that human users can understand.
